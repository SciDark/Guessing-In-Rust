# Guessing-In-Rust
So, if you've seen my Replit projects, you likely know that to learn a language, I will make a guessing game. These are known as the Guessing In [] series.
<br /><br />
For languages that I'm *very* interested in, such as Rust in this case, I will add extra features, such as difficulties. This is one of those times. I also decided to learn Git doing this, hence why it's here.

<h2> Hope 'ya enjoy this, I guess! </h2>
